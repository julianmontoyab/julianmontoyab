# Embedded Systems Engineer 

Hi, I'm Julian - I design and build embedded systems that bridge firmware and hardware, with experience in C/C++, ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, RTOS, and I2C/SPI communication.
I’ve led projects including hybrid stepper motor controllers, autonomous robots, and Linux-based aquaponic farm automation.

### Skills
- **Firmware:** C/C++, bare-metal, RTOS, interrupt-driven drivers
- **Hardware:** STM32, MSP430, MSP432, Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino
- **Interfaces:** I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC
- **Tools:** GNU Arm Toolchain, mySQL, Git, Bash

### Featured Projects
- [**Linux-Based Embedded Systems Development (CIA-Sponsored Project)**](https://github.com/julianm-7/linux-embedded-farm-automation) — Linux-based embedded farm automation system integrating C++/Python motor + LiDAR control with cloud-connected machine learning crop analysis
- [**Lead Embedded Systems Developer – Hybrid Stepper Motor**](https://github.com/julianm-7/HybridStepperMotor) — Embedded C firmware on MSP430 for hybrid stepper motor control with I2C light sensor–based input feeback
- [**Autonomous Maze-Navigation Robot**](https://github.com/julianm-7/Autonomous-Maze-Navigation-Robot) — MSP432-based autonomous maze-navigation robot with IR sensors and C++ PID-controlled wheel actuation for precise path tracking.
- [**Raspberry Pi-based Embedded System Projects**](link) — Vice President, IEEE — led Raspberry Pi embedded projects and obtained $5,000 sponsorship to increase student participation.
- [**Full-Stack Web Development with Python**](https://github.com/Frankie915/TennisSchedule) — Full-stack tennis scheduling web app using Flask and MySQL with dynamic, responsive interfaces and optimized queries.

### Currently Learning
- FreeRTOS / RTOS concepts (task scheduling, semaphores, queues)
- Machine learning inference on microcontrollers (TinyML, edge AI)
